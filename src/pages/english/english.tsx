                        I have several tasks that I need to complete by the end of the day. The weather is cold and overcast, with the temperature around +5°C and occasional rain. It's typical winter weather for Ukraine.

                        My main motivation is simple: I need to earn a living. To achieve this, I must work in an international company and communicate with people from different countries. I need to understand tasks clearly and complete them on time. Additionally, I must participate in project discussions and find the best possible solutions.

                    <div className={style.english__description}>
                        I personally prefer to get as much practice as possible. Before practicing, however, I try to memorize the words I plan to use. Then, I ask an AI to create sentences for me. I read and repeat the full sentences, and finally, I use these phrases when communicating with my colleagues at work. Since I need English for work, I try to practice by participating in all discussions related to my project. I also watch YouTube videos with subtitles to memorize common phrases. Additionally, I run my own channel in English, where I create videos and record my own voiceovers. Sometimes, I have to repeat a sentence ten times before it is added to the video.

                    <div className={style.english__description}>
                        Individual online lessons might be the best option. I can study vocabulary in silence on my own, and then spend the lesson time talking to a teacher who can correct my mistakes. It saves time since I don't have to commute across the city. However, in this case, I don't always catch people's reactions, and I find it hard to read their emotions. If I start feeling really lonely, I'd prefer a real meeting in a cafe where I can get some live interaction.

                    <div className={style.english__description}>
                        To study English, I really enjoy watching YouTube videos with subtitles.
                        I’ve even built my own app for learning English. You can save words and their translations, and then play a game where you assemble words from a set of letters. Once you get a word right ten times, it’s considered mastered and moves to the archive. Ultimately, the final stage is a real conversation with a partner. I often use English for work, communicating with people from different countries—it's the best way to improve. I can't say which one is more important. Every stage is important.

                        I have attended conferences. To be more precise, I was just there as an observer. However, the speakers usually talk about obvious things that I already know or things that I can easily find online. I don't like such conferences. The best practice is to have your own project and look for solutions yourself or ask your colleagues. In my opinion, conferences are a waste of time

                        The most important skill you should have is the ability to speak fluently. Your speech should be as smooth and natural as possible. You also need to have a strong understanding of your partner. Furthermore, you must be ready to argue your point and insist on the best solutions.
                        You should be able to find good conversation examples from online resources

                        I've taken English courses before, but they didn't lead to good results. The main problem was that I didn't do the homework, which is one of the most crucial parts of learning English.
                        Nevertheless, I have improved my English level from A1 to B1.
                        Currently, I'm taking English classes twice a week again.

                    <div className={style.english__description}>
                        I prefer studying English in the evening. In the morning, my brain is still foggy. I need to wake up and finish a few small tasks before I can start absorbing information effectively.

                        Personal data is, of course, of great importance. This includes your financial information, such as card numbers and security codes. Equally important is the privacy of your home address. I value my privacy because I want to ensure that no stranger can influence my life without my consent.
                        The first thing you should pay attention to is the URL of a webpage — the connection must be encrypted. You should also read reviews of any application you intend to use. When installing an app, it is essential to read the terms of use and pay close attention to the permissions it requests, such as access to your contacts or unrestricted use of mobile data.

                        In my program, I will recommend getting as much practice as possible. However, before that, you must have a solid vocabulary. You should memorize at least 10 new words every day.
                        Moving forward, I will select suitable videos for beginners within the program. I might also find several games to make learning English more engaging. Finally, there should be an exam where you can receive a grade and feedback on your knowledge
